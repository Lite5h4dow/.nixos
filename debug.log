Despite this, Becky assures her support for Anya, not allowing her to apologize to Damian. Loid, who is tailing Anya, sends different messages to her, pressuring her to apologize, and she finally does while Becky is away. However, Damian, who has fallen for her, runs away in embarrassment when he refuses to acknowledge his feelings. As a result, Loid erroneously believes his second plan has failed. Back home, Loid tries to make Anya study, hoping to progress the original plan, but she wears herself out. Yor tells Loid not to be so harsh with Anya as Loid realizes he is being tough on her just for his aspirations. Yor then tells Loid that Anya views him as a good father, but when she apologizes for interfering, Loid asserts that she is part of their family. Loid then goes to check on Anya, finding her asleep on her desk, having tried to study on her own. He puts Anya to bed wondering what it feels like to have a real family. Elsewhere, Yuri, Yor's brother, learns of his sister's marriage.
